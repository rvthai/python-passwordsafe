# Python Password Safe

**Python Password Safe** is a simple password manager CLI tool written in Python.

**Python Password Safe** allows you to save an encrypted list of username-password entries organized into different groups of your making. All you have to do is create and remember one master PIN number in order to unlock your password safe.

> **Note:** This project was independently made for the purposes of learning new
> cryptography tools, practicing database interactions with SQLite, and developing a
> personal password manager for my local machine. Therefore, strong security is not
> guaranteed. Please use at your own risk!
